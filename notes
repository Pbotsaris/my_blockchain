## TODO
1. need to be able to add a block to an exsitent node with no block
2. add block "cat" * needs to impact all the previous nodes
3. remove the option to add a node when doing `add block new_node 12`
4. rm node * should remove all nodes


## ERRORS
you can pass rm block cat 12 // where rm block can accept only 1 argument which is the name of the block
